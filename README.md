# RopePhysics
! WORK IN PROGRESS !

## Demos:
Demo 1:
![Alt](demos/rope1.gif)
This shows 2 nodes connected by a line between them (the line does not apply any force to the nodes
yet, this will change) and the nodes being affected by forces like gravity, bounce and friction.

### Todo:
 - Create sticks between nodes with active forces
 - Get mouse input to interact with program
 - Create chain of nodes with sticks inbetween
 - UI
